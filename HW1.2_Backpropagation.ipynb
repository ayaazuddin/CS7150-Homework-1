The amount of memory consumed by backpropagation can vary widely depending on $n$, $d$, $b$, the complexity of the computation graph, and exactly which gradients you wish to compute.  So in practice you should remember:\n",

        " * Disable autograd when you do not need gradients, because building computation graphs can consume a lot of memory.\n",
        " * Set `requires_grad=False` on any specific variables that do not need gradients, because that can also save memory.\n",
        " * You may be able to save a lot of memory by reducing your batch size $b$, depending on your model size (i.e., depending on $d$ and $n$).  Gradient accumulation can be used to accumulate larger batch gradients out of many small batches.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you are desparate for memory because backpropagation is using too much, it is possible to change the tradeoff and spend some additional computation to do backpropagation with less memory.  The method is called [gradient checkpointing](https://github.com/cybertronai/gradient-checkpointing), and it is available in both pytorch and tensorflow. [(Pytorch documentation here.)](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/checkpoint.html)  The idea was proposed by [Griewank (1992)](https://papers.baulab.info/also/Griewank-1992.pdf), and it works by discarding some of the intermediate results of the forward pass, and recomputing them right before they are needed during the backward pass."
